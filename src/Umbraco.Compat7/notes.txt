** Umbraco.Compat7

The purpose of Umbraco.Compat7 is to help support v7 sites in v8, by providing
an implementation of most of the important interfaces and services that have
been removed in v8.

This includes:

- ApplicationContext
    compat: full
    status: done

- IApplicationEventHandler
    compat: UmbracoApplicationBase ApplicationStarting & ApplicationStarted events
	  are gone. Use corresponding Compat7Component events instead, should be mostly
	  the same.
    status: to be tested

- Resolvers
    compat: full
    status: 
	  base resolvers: done
	  resolvers: TODO

- RenderModel, UmbracoTemplatePage
    compat: will NOT support dynamics, so CurrentPage will prob not work
    status: need to test RendeModel, not sure it works at all

What else?

- IPublishedContent GetPropertyValue extension methods
- ?

** Building

By default, Umbraco.Compat7 is built but not copied / nothing.
If the conditional symbol 'COMPAT7' is defined, it is copied to Umbraco.Web.UI/bin.
Currently, that symbol is defined for the DEBUG build.
Eventually it should become an extra NuGet package.
