    // The factory
    // - always picks the constructor with the most parameters
    // - supports Lazy parameters (and prefers them over non-Lazy) in constructors
    // - what happens with 'releasing' is unclear
    //
    // The registry
    // - supports registering a service, even after some instances of other services have been created
    // - supports re-registering a service, as long as no instance of that service has been created
    // - throws when re-registering a service, and an instance of that service has been created
    //
    // - registers only one implementation of a nameless service, re-registering replaces the previous
    //   registration - names are required to register multiple implementations - and getting an
    //   IEnumerable of the service, nameless, returns them all
